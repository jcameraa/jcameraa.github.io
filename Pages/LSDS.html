							This game was the second time I participated in the Global Game Jam, and due to my extra year’s worth of experience under my belt I had a bigger role. We all functioned as some part of the design team since we had a team of 5, but I also took on the bigger role of Lead programmer. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Because most of our team had at least one previous game jam experience under our belt, we decided to make a Twitch-integrated game that streamers can use to engage with their viewers. We accomplished this by making a Unity game that is able to get the chat of the streamer and use viewer-inputted commands to control their player.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this programming position, I took on the task of programming one of the main mechanics of the game, while also managing communication among programmers on the team. The mechanic I programmed was the AI control, which included spawning in enemies based on their player’s desired destination, and manipulating the A* pathfinding algorithm to fit the player’s best interest.
