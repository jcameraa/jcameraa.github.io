							Thanks you for visiting my website! Seeing as you came to this page, I assume you want to know some things about me. The hard basic are that I am a sophomore at Northeastern University pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Game Design and I have an expected graduation date of May 2021. The fun basics are that I really love making games, and my goal is to continue my education in them and make spectacular games for people to enjoy. I intend to focus on game programming and game design, and I would also love to gain more experience in game production!
						</p>
						<p>
							I have had various types of roles in my group experiences with games, ranging from lead programmer to narrative design! I also have worked in groups as large as 11 to make a game in 48 hours, to concepting, designing, and implementing a game by myself.  The variety of projects I have worked on has taught me a vast set of skills, all of which I hope to utilize as I further my career. 
						</p>
						<p>
							My education at Northeastern has taught me a great amount about what it means to make games, and with every class I take and project I work on I continue to build my skills. Besides creating games in classes, I have also found myself making games recreationally, namely during Game Jams. Since I started my path towards a Game Design degree in September of 2017, I have attended two Global Game Jams, and this past year have participated in the Anti-Defamation League Game Jam. All of these experiences have been some of my best experiences in regards to game design, and they further confirm my passion for creating these playful experiences. 
						</p>
						<p>
							All in all, I truly love creating games and intend to continue making them. I have the communication skills required to work in an industry that is so collaborative and display this when I work on teams. I believe in learning something from each experience you have, no matter how well the final piece turns out to be, and I have been lucky enough to produce games I am proud of and have also learned from! I am very eager to enter this industry, so if any of this sounded interesting to you, please contact me through my email: <a href = "Camera.j@husky.neu.edu">Camera.j@husky.neu.edu</a>
