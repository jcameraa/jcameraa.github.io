						<p>
							Thank you for visiting my website! I am a second-year student at Northeastern University pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Game Design with an expected graduation date of May 2021. I love making games, and my goal is to continue my education in them and make spectacular games for others to enjoy. I intend to focus on game programming and game design, and I would love to gain more experience in game production!

						</p>
						<p>
							I have had various roles in my group experiences with games, ranging from lead programmer to narrative design. I have worked in groups as large as 11 to make a game in 48 hours, as well as concepting, designing, and implementing a game by myself. The variety of projects I have worked on has taught me a vast set of skills, namely game programming and game design, all of which I hope to utilize as I further my career.

						</p>
						<p>
							My education at Northeastern has greatly taught me what it means to make games, and with every class I take and project I work on I continue to build my skills. Besides creating games in classes, I have also made games recreationally, especially during Game Jams. Since I started my path toward a Game Design degree in September  2017, I have attended two Global Game Jams, and this past year have participated in the Anti-Defamation League Game Jam. All of these experiences have been some of my favorites in regards to game design, and they further ignite my passion for creating meaningful games.

						</p>
						<p>
							All in all, I truly love creating games and am excited to continue making them. I have the communication skills required to work in a collaborative industry and I display this when I work on teams. I believe in learning something from every experience, no matter how well the final piece turns out to be, and I have been lucky enough to produce games I am proud of and have also learned from! I am very eager to enter the game design and production industry, and I would love to discuss any projects and opportunities.
